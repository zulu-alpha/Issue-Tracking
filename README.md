# Zulu-Alpha Issue Tracking

High level goals for all aspects of Zulu-Alpha (and small, specific tasks or issues if they have no repo) are added here.

Projects are long term goals and give you an overview of what we want to achieve by the end of the year. You can see them [here](https://github.com/zulu-alpha/Issue-Tracking/projects).

Milestones are medium term goals, are mentioned in the projects and can be found [here](https://github.com/zulu-alpha/Issue-Tracking/milestones).

Issues are small, specific tasks or problems to solve for every aspect of ZA. They can be found [here](https://github.com/zulu-alpha/Issue-Tracking/issues), but all of these issues can be found in their relevant Project board and milestone (as every issue must belong to both).

Other issues that are smaller and more specific to a different repo of ZA may be made in those repos, though we may standardize so that absolutely all issues go into this repo.

## Involvement

All ZA members are welcome to be involved here. This is a great place to see what needs to be done and pitch in.
To get involved, all you need to do is sign in with GitHub and contact Phoenix for you to be added to the Team.
If you are intimately involved with the tasks of a particular office, then you will be invited to be a part of that office for more streamlined communication in Discord.

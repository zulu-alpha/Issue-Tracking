# Zulu-Alpha Issue Tracking

High level goals for all aspects of Zulu-Alpha (and small, specific tasks or issues if they have no repo) are added here.
Projects are long term goals and Milestones are Medium term goals.
Small, specific issues or tasks for aspects of ZA that already have their own repo can be added there, though time will tell if it's more wether we will be centralizing absolutely everything here.

## Involvement

All ZA members are welcome to be involved here. This is a great place to see what needs to be done and pitch in.
To get involved, all you need to do is sign in with GitHub and contact Phoenix for you to be added to the Team.
If you are intimately involved with the tasks of a particular office, then you will be invited to be a part of that office for more streamlined communication in Discord.
